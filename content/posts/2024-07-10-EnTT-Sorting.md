# EnTT Sorting Examples

I have used EnTT for small hobby projects in the past. Usually in conjuction with SFML.
Currently working on a solitaire game with SDL, and using EnTT to handle the entities for the game.

I would like to share some examples of sorting with the EnTT library. I couldn't find many example posts about the subject online.
However, the EnTT library does have some useful test code to get me started.


```cpp
entt::registry world;
```
