CMake is a blessing and curse. It is marvelous how it allows you to cross platform develop to fully
with C++.

However the syntax and developer experience when new to it leaves much to be desired.
For the past year or so I have been using CMake pretty much exclusively for my C++ projects. I would like to 
share some examples in CMake that hopefully help you not fall into the same rabbit holes I found myself in.
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)
```
